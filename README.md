"Neural Network Implemented on a Wheeled Robot using Backpropagation and Arduino Chips Emulated as Nodes"

The two classes- Perceptron and MultiLayerPerceptron- in this Repository are the basics of a simulated Neural Network in machine learning and computational intelligence theory. 

Where I am going with this is to be able to implement a fully functional network through hardware- learning will also happen live and not offline.

• Researched Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as selected funded intern at Connecticut College to implement ANN on a wheeled remote controlled robot using Arduino microprocessor hardware in working towards publishing a paper 

• Programmed (Java/Scheme) a 4 layer ANN -2 hidden layers- that uses backpropagation and sigmoid activation functions to learn live within 1% error and take any amount of input and output nodes applied by a user

• Using Arudino software language, converted Java code to successfully program a single hardware Arduino to act as Perceptron node capable of taking input and producing output- blinking light

• Currently working on future goals: 
↪ utilizing 3 Arduino chips to solve XOR logic gate with all input-output options
↪ researching efficient ways to transfer data through pins on Arduino chips
↪ have Arduino chips take inputs from sensors that will go on robot 
↪ have a communicative Neural Network where each node is an Arduino chip itself
